# From Operational to Data Warehousing

**ETL**

The whole process of extracting data from the Operational Databases and to transform them into a Data Warehouse is called ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Load).



## OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing)



## Star Schemas

There are Three main components of the Star Schema:

\1. Facts

​		Facts are numeric measurements (values) that represent a specific business aspect or activity.

​		For example, sales figures are numeric measurements that represent product and/or service sales.

\2. Dimensions

​		Dimensions are qualifying characteristics that provide additional perspectives to a given fact.

​		For example, sales might be viewed from specific dimension(s), such as sales location, sales period, sales product, etc.

\3. Attributes

​		Each dimension table contains attributes.
